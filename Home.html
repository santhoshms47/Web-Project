		<h3><abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> announces COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic</h3>
		<p>	
			Today, as WHO / Europe’s Standing Committee met, Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe, 
			briefed the group on the rapid escalation of COVID-19 in the WHO European Region, now placing it at the centre of this pandemic.
			As of the morning of 12 March, there are more than 20 000 confirmed cases and there have been almost 1000 deaths in the European Region.
		</p>
		<p>
			Dr Kluge stated that the number of cases is expected to increase further. He urged countries to continue to implement a containment strategy while accelerating their efforts to control the disease.
			Countries should prepare to respond to different public health scenarios, recognizing that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to managing cases and outbreaks of COVID-19. Each country should assess its risk, 
			the measures in place and their social acceptability, and rapidly implement the necessary interventions at the appropriate scale to stop or slow down COVID-19 transmission while minimizing economic, public and social impacts.

		<h3>Trump dumps Russia, woos China instead</h3>
		<p>	
			Once upon a time, Trump mused about how well he and Russian President Vladimir Putin would get along. Then-candidate Trump said Putin had declared him a "genius," 
			criticized the Obama administration's tensions with Moscow and said it would be better "if we got along."
			China, on the other hand, was a currency manipulator, a thief of US jobs that should no longer be allowed to "<del>rape</del> our country".
		</p>
		<p>
			If elected, Trump promised to impose heavy tariffs on Beijing and take it to court for shady trade practices.
			This month, during which his administration has stepped up US military action in Syria and Afghanistan as he looks to reassert US power, Trump said that "we're not getting along with Russia at all, we may be at an all-time low." He and Chinese President Xi Jinping, on the other hand, have "a good chemistry," Trump declared.
			The President's reversal on Russia and China is part of a series of policy flip-flops that have seen Trump abandon campaign positions on <abbr title="The North Atlantic Treaty Organization">NATO</abbr> , Israel, the Iran nuclear agreement and US alliances in Asia.

		<h3>Coronavirus halts a decade of US jobs growth</h3>
		<p>
			A decade of jobs growth in the US came to an abrupt halt in March as employers shed 701,000 jobs amid the coronavirus outbreak.
			The unemployment rate rose to 4.4% in the biggest one-month jump since 1975, according to new data from the US Department of Labor.
			The hospitality industries accounted for more than half the cuts.
		</p>
		<p>
			The losses are believed to now be worse since the data was collected early in the month.
			Since then, cases of coronavirus have jumped to more than 245,000 and a majority of states have put lockdown measures in place, forcing most businesses to close.
			State filings show about 10 million people have registered for unemployment benefits in the last two weeks - record figures that far eclipse previous highs.
			"It's clear that the pandemic is already having a more significant impact on the labour market than most had expected even a week ago," said Andrew Hunter, senior US economist at Capital Economics.

		<h3><abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> and <abbr title="United Nations Children's Fund">UNICEF</abbr> to partner on pandemic response through COVID-19 Response Fund</h3>
		<p>
			WHO and UNICEF today announced an agreement to work together on COVID-19 response, through the historic COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund powered by the United Nations Foundation and Swiss Philanthropy Foundation.  
			The COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund has been set up to facilitate an unprecedented global response by supporting the WHO Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan.
		</p>
		<p>
			As part of the agreement, an initial portion of the money from the Fund – which currently stands at more than $127 million – will flow to UNICEF for its work with vulnerable children and communities all over the world.
			The money collected through the fund will be used, among others, to train and equip communities and health-care workers to prevent, detect and treat COVID-19. It will help countries expand their health-care capacity and mitigate its social impact, 
			especially on women, children and vulnerable social groups. And it will accelerate research and development of treatments and preventive vaccines.

		<h3>TESLA is dismissing contractors</h3>
		<p>
			Tesla is letting go of contractors from its U.S. car and battery plants, according to three workers and correspondence shared with CNBC.
			The company is cutting contractors from its workforce, both in its vehicle factory in Fremont, California, and at the Gigafactory outside of Reno, Nevada, where Tesla makes the signature battery packs that power its electric vehicles and energy storage products. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The cuts affect hundreds, according to estimates from the people familiar with the move, who asked for anonymity because they are not authorized to talk to press about internal matters.
			Temps -- many of whom worked at Tesla for years, some hoping to jump into full-time roles -- were notified by their staffing agencies about the cuts late this week. 
			A memo from Balance Staffing to dismissed workers said: “It is with my deepest regret that I must inform you that the Tesla factory shutdown has been extended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and as a result, Tesla has requested to end all contract assignments effective immediately.”

		<h3>Govt to IPL: We advise against it but your call</h3>
		<p>
			The possibility of IPL 2020 being a severely restricted tournament - with at least some part of it being played to empty stands - in light of the coronavirus threat has increased following statements by two key ministries of the Indian government on Thursday. 
			While the sports ministry said it would not stop sporting events from taking place as long as they adhere strictly to governmental guidelines, discouraging mass gatherings, the external affairs (foreign) ministry went a step further and said their advice was to not go ahead with the tournament at this time, but left the decision to the organisers.
		</p>
		<p>
			The IPL itself is yet to issue a statement on the tournament but its Governing Council is scheduled to meet franchises on March 14 in Mumbai. The 13th edition of the tournament will likely feature nearly 60 overseas players, arriving from and through different parts of the globe that have been affected by the pandemic.
			The IPL is the most lucrative tournament in cricket and offers the BCCI as well as the eight franchises substantial sums of money.
