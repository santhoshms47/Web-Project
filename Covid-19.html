		<b>On December 31, 2019, the <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr></b> China office heard the first reports of a previously-unknown virus behind a number of pneumonia cases in Wuhan, a city in Eastern China with a population of over 11 million.
	</p>
	<p>	
		Coronavirus (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). What started as an epidemic mainly limited to China has now become a truly global pandemic. There have now been over 939,436 confirmed cases and 42,365 deaths, according the John Hopkins University Covid-19 dashboard, which collates information from national and international health authorities. 
		The disease has been detected in more than 200 countries and territories, with Italy, the US and Spain experiencing the most widespread outbreaks outside of China. In the UK, there have been 29,474 confirmed cases and 2,352 deaths as of April 1.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Chinese government responded to the initial outbreak by placing Wuhan and nearby cities under a de-facto quarantine encompassing roughly 50 million people in Hubei province. This quarantine is now slowly being lifted, as authorities watch to see whether cases will rise again. 
		The US is now the new epicentre of the Covid-19 outbreak, becoming the first country to surpass China's total confirmed cases. As of April 2, the country has 216,722 confirmed infections and 5,137 deaths. In Italy, where the death toll surpassed that of China on March 19, 
		the government took the unprecedented step of extending a lockdown to the entire country, shutting cinemas, theatres, gyms, discos and pubs and banning funerals and weddings. In the UK, the government has shut schools, pubs, restaurants, bars cafés and all non-essential shops.

	<h2 align="center">How did Covid-19 start?</h2>
	<img src="Images/Bat.jpg" alt="No img" id="CovidImg"> 
	<p>
		The disease appears to have originated from a Wuhan seafood market where wild animals, including marmots, birds, rabbits, bats and snakes, are traded illegally. Coronaviruses are known to jump from animals to humans, so it’s thought that the first people infected with the disease 
		– a group primarily made up of stallholders from the seafood market – contracted it from contact with animals.
	</p>
	<p>
		The hunt for the animal source of Covid-19 is still unknown, although there are some strong contenders. A team of virologists at the Wuhan Institute for Virology released a detailed paper showing that the new coronaviruses' genetic makeup is 96 per cent identical to that of a coronavirus found in bats,
		while a study published on March 26 argues that genetic sequences of coronavirus in pangolins are between 88.5 and 92.4 per cent similar to the human virus. Some early cases of Covid-19, however, appear to have inflicted people with no link to the Wuhan market at all, suggesting that the initial route of human infection may pre-date the market cases.
		The Chinese government responded to the initial outbreak by placing Wuhan and nearby cities under a de-facto quarantine encompassing roughly 50 million people in Hubei province. This quarantine is now slowly being lifted, as authorities watch to see whether cases will rise again.

	<h2 align="center">What are the symptoms of Covid-19?</h2>
	<img src="Images/coronavirus-symptoms-data.png" alt="No img" id="CovidImg"> 
	<p>
		Covid-19 shares many of its symptoms with the flu or common cold, although there are certain symptoms common to flu and colds that are not usually seen in Covid-19.
	</p>
	<p>People may experience:
		<ul>
			<li>Cough</li>
			<li>Fever</li>
			<li>Tiredness</li>
			<li>Difficulty in breathing (Severe cases)</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>
		The most common Covid-19 symptoms are a fever and a dry cough. Of 55,924 early Chinese cases of the disease, nearly 90 per cent of patients experienced a fever and just over two-thirds suffered with a dry cough. That’s why the UK government is advising anyone with a high temperature or a new, continuous cough to stay at home for seven days or, if they live with other people, 
		for the entire household to isolate for 14 days from the first onset of symptoms.
	</p>
	<p>
		Other Covid-19 symptoms are less common. Just under 40 per cent of people with the disease experience fatigue, while a third of people cough up sputum – a thick mucus from within the lungs. Other rarer symptoms include shortness of breath, muscle pain, sore throats, headaches or chills, loss of smell or taste. According to the WHO, symptoms tend to appear between five and six days after infection.

	<p>There’s currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease (COVID-19).</p>
	<p>You can protect yourself and help prevent spreading the virus to others if you:</p>
	<p>Do
		<ul>
			<li>Wash your hands regularly for 20 seconds, with soap and water or alcohol-based hand rub</li>
			<li>Cover your nose and mouth with a disposable tissue or flexed elbow when you cough or sneeze</li>
			<li>Avoid close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell</li>
			<li>Stay home and self-isolate from others in the household if you feel unwell</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>Don't
		<ul>
			<li>Touch your eyes, nose, or mouth if your hands are not clean</li>
		</ul>
