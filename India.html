		<h2>Modi Orders 3-Week Total Lockdown for All 1.3 Billion Indians</h2>
		<p>
			Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the new measure Tuesday, saying that people would have to remain in their homes for the next 21 days with only essential services remaining open. 
			The move is designed to curb the virus’s spread and keep the country’s already-fragile health system from buckling under a surge of critically ill patients.
			The government is setting aside $2 billion to bolster India’s medical infrastructure and care for those infected with the coronavirus, Modi said.
		</p>
		<p>
			The threat of the virus spreading further, as well as the new lockdown, have also put India’s economic growth at risk. The country has already struggled to achieve higher growth and economists are anticipating a further slowdown in GDP. 
			The breadth and depth of such a challenge is staggering in a country where hundreds of millions of citizens are destitute and countless millions live in packed urban areas with poor sanitation and weak public health care.
			The lockdown includes schools, offices, factories, parks, temples, railways, even the airspace. Borders are being sealed between the states.

			<p>Prime Minister Narendra Modi today shared a video clip of BJP veteran Atal Bihari Vajpayee reciting his famous poem, to remind people to light up lamps on Sunday night to show the country's "collective resolve" to fight coronavirus.</p>
			<p>"Aao diya jalayen" (come let''s light the lamp), PM Modi tweeted.</p>
			<p>"Aao phir se diya jalayen" is an iconic poem by the former prime minister.</p>
			<p>PM Modi also asked people to maintain the "lakshman rekha" of social distancing by staying indoors and not getting together in groups during the exercise. "Today when crores of people are inside homes, then some of us may think how will they fight this battle against COVID-19 alone. 
				Such questions might come up in your mind? But please remember, none of us is alone. The strength of 130 crores of Indians is with each one of us," he had said.
			</p>
			<p>He also thanked people for supporting the ongoing lockdown, the Janata Curfew on March 22 and said that it was a symbol of unity of 130 crore Indians in fight against the coronavirus. 
			"The way you paid gratitude to people fighting against COVID-19, on March 22 has become a model that is being emulated by other countries. Janata curfew and ringing of bells/clanging utensils made the country aware of its unity amid this challenging time," PM Modi had said. 
			</p>
			<p>In his small video message, PM Modi said that the nation that many people must have felt alone being at home during the ongoing lockdown but they must realise that the collective strength of 130 crore Indians is with each one of them.
			"In this darkness spread by the coronavirus pandemic, we must continuously progress towards light and hope. We must continuously strive to take those of us most affected, our poor brothers and sisters, 
			from disappointment to hope. We must end the darkness and uncertainty emanating from the crisis, by progressing towards light and certainty," he had said.
